# UI build
Create a **public** repository, with the name `final-exam-uibuild`.  
**Work in the created repository!**

Make a UI build from the 4 attached pictures:
 - `uibuild_desktop.png` for the desktop view
 - `uibuild_mobile_1.png` and `uibuild_mobile_2.png` for the mobile view
 - `uibuild_hover` for the hover effect

The solution should be presented on Github Pages, with a link like this: https://username.github.io/final-exam-uibuild

You should make your content from the attached `data.js` file *(tip: copy the file to the created repository)*
